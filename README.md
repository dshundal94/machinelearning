Machine Learning Class taught by Andrew Ng
I completed the class on 11/13/2016 and decided to upload the work I accomplished to GitHub to showcase the different methods
I learned for machine learning applications. Concretely, the following exercises dealt with linear and logistic regression, Neural
Networks, Support Vector Machines, K-Means Algorithm, Principle Component Analysis (PCA), and Anamoly Detection. Also included were
special applications and topics including Recommender Systems and Large Scale Machine Learning. I build a spam classifier and even 
compressed images, so check it out and hopefully it can be of some use for some people.
